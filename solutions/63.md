### My solution
Just a slight modication of problem 62.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        """
        :type obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        N, M = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        
        table = [[0 for i in range(M)] for i in range(N)]
        
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(M):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j]:
                    table[i][j] = 0
                elif i == 0 and j == 0:
                    table[i][j] = 1
                elif i == 0 and j > 0:
                    table[i][j] = table[i][j-1]
                elif j == 0 and i > 0:
                    table[i][j] = table[i-1][j]
                else:
                    table[i][j] = table[i-1][j] + table[i][j-1]
                    
        return table[-1][-1]
