### My solution
I initially tried to derive a mathematical formula for computing this, and ended up with (m + n - 2)C(min(m - 1, n - 1)). To compute this, I have to either use   
- nCr = (n / r) * (n-1) C (r) which is O(r), but unfortunately this becomes inaccurate when n is large. 
- nCr = (n-1)C(r-1) + (n-1)C(r) which is O(nr) if you use the DP approach.

Neither of these approaches are better than just counting the paths manually using a (n x m) DP table!!

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        table = [[None for i in range(m)] for i in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if i == 0 and j == 0:
                    table[i][j] = 1
                elif i == 0 and j > 0:
                    table[i][j] = table[i][j-1]
                elif j == 0 and i > 0:
                    table[i][j] = table[i-1][j]
                else:
                    table[i][j] = table[i][j-1] + table[i-1][j]
                    
        return table[-1][-1]
